# myWaveApp


The user of the app can PUT an image to the application and automatic caputres will be generated with the help of the trained NN

LSTM + CNN enconder/decoder architecture is used. 

Core Components:
1. Model is going to be trained on MS COCO dataset https://cocodataset.org/#home.
2. h2o.ai Wave framework is used for the application layer
3. PyTorch is used for the NN Architecture
